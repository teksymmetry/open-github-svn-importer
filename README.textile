== Import SVN repository to your favorite GIT
You can import and sync with your changes on SVN repository with GIT
repository at anytime.

== How to install?
<GIT PATH> get the source from here and extract on your directory

== How to import?
 1. First you have to install "git-core" and "svn" on your machine
 2. You should have "ssh-agent" and "ssh-add" related tools
 3. Kick new terminal
 4. $ eval `ssh-agent`
 5. $ ssh-add
 6. Thus you keep your ssh authentication key and password in ssh agent
    so whenever GIT fireup new shell to execute commands it won't bother
    you asking password for your public key.
 7. Go to your "svnongit" extracted directory
 8. Ensure you have enough permission
 9. $ ./svnongit <git repo> <local path> <svn repo> 
 10. +git repo+ ie. git@github.com:we4tech/testproject.git
 11. +local path+ warning: this directory will be removed before reinitiating git project
     ie. /var/repo/abc
 12. +svn repo+ ie. svn://abc.com/test

Best of luck!
